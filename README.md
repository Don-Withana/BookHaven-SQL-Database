<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a SQL database designed for a bookstore management system named **BookHaven** with complete `ERD` diagrams. It contains various tables that store information about books, customers, orders, items, suppliers, and payments. The project uses MySQL as the database server.

### Built With

SQL: The primary language used for designing and managing the database structure and performing data operations.
<br>
DBMS (Database Management System): Utilized to manage and interact with the SQL database, ensuring data integrity and efficient querying.
<br>
ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram): Created to visually represent the data model and relationships between entities within the bookstore database.

## Database Structure

The database `bookhaven` consists of the following tables:

- **book**: Stores information about books such as item code, ISBN, title, genre, category, author, publisher, and year of publication.
- **customer**: Stores customer details like customer ID, name, NIC, contact number, email address, and postal address.
- **item**: Contains information on items such as item code, price, and stock level.
- **order_**: Stores order details including order ID, quantity, order date, delivery date, destination address, payment ID, and customer ID.
- **order_item**: Maps the relationship between orders and items.
- **payment**: Records payment information such as payment ID, amount, date, time, and payment type ID.
- **payment_type**: Defines different types of payment methods.
- **stationary**: Stores details about stationary items.
- **stock**: Represents the stock information for items and their suppliers.
- **supplier**: Stores supplier details such as supplier ID and name.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Installation

To set up the database locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bookhaven-sql-database.git
   cd bookhaven-sql-database
   ```

2. Import the SQL Dump:
Open phpMyAdmin or any `MySQL/MariaDB` client.
Create a new database named bookhaven.
Import the `bookhaven.sql` file included in this repository.

3. Run SQL Scripts:
Ensure that all tables are created and data is loaded by executing the SQL commands in the `bookhaven.sql` file.

## Usage

This database can be used to manage the inventory, customer orders, and payment processing of a bookstore. To interact with the database, you can use SQL queries to retrieve, insert, update, or delete data as required.

## Example Queries

1. Retrieve all books in the store:
   ```bash
   SELECT * FROM book;
   ```
2. Get details of a specific customer:
   ```bash
   SELECT * FROM customer WHERE cust_id = '4001';
   ```
3. Check stock levels of items:
   ```bash
   SELECT * FROM item WHERE stock_level > 0;
   ```

## Data Dump

The SQL dump included in this repository contains initial data for testing and development purposes. It is not intended for use in a production environment.
